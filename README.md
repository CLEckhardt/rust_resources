## Why Rust?

There are a lot of reasons you might want to learn and use Rust. I've found
they vary across people and organizations, and they change over time and with
more experience. I've linked some discussions of "why Rust?" below; however,
given this simple question forms a expansive and nuanced topic, these are
simply a few perspectives.

These focus more on "why Rust?" in a professional context. On a personal level,
"why Rust?" is really up to you. Talking to other folks on the Rust-learning
journey can help bump your inspiration and motivation. But if you are
struggling to come up with a reason besides "all the cool kids are doing it and
I don't want to be left out," don't sweat it and go spend your time on
something you enjoy more. Rust will still be here if you want to come back to
it.

## New? Start here

[Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) here.

This list is sorted by how broadly helpful I think these resources could be,
i.e. resources that more folks find helpful are listed higher up. We all learn
differently and have different backgrounds, so use whichever work for you.

I'd recommend starting at the top of this list - if something isn't working for
you, move on to the next one. Or pick the one that sounds the most interesting
(though I'd recommend starting with a comprehensive resource).
